pycares is a Python module which provides an interface to c-ares.
`c-ares <http://c-ares.haxx.se>`_ is a C library that performs
DNS requests and name resolutions asynchronously.


Documentation

Bundled c-ares
==============

pycares currently bundles c-ares and as of pycares 1.0.0 this is a strong requirement. Upstream
c-ares is not willing to apply `a patch adding TTL support <http://c-ares.haxx.se/mail/c-ares-archive-2013-07/0005.shtml>`_.
I did apply the patch to the bundled c-ares, but unfortunately it breaks the ABI, so attempting
to use a system provided c-ares is not possible.


Building
========

Linux:

::

    python setup.py install

FreeBSD:

::

    cd /usr/ports/dns/py-pycares && make install

Mac OSX:

::

    (XCode needs to be installed)
    export ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64"
    python setup.py install

Microsoft Windows (with Visual Studio 2008, 2010, 2015 or the Windows SDK):

::

    ./build_inplace


Running the test suite
======================

There are several ways of running the test ruite:

- Run the test with the current Python interpreter:

  From the toplevel directory, run: ``python tests/tests.py``

- Use Tox to run the test suite in several virtualenvs with several interpreters

  From the toplevel directory, run: ``tox -e py27,py33,py34,py35`` this will run the test suite
  on Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 (you'll need to have them installed beforehand)
